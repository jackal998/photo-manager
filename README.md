# Photo Manager

A Windows tool for **deduplication scanning and review** of large personal photo collections.

Produces `migration_manifest.sqlite` consumed by **[photo-transfer](https://github.com/jackal998/photo-transfer)** for the actual file migration.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11, Python 3.11+
- [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) on `PATH` (required for EXIF date extraction)
- Dependencies installed in a venv (see Install below)

### Install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/jackal998/photo-manager.git
cd photo-manager
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Launch (GUI)

```powershell
run.bat          # activates .venv and starts main.py
# or
.venv\Scripts\python main.py
```

### Run tests

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest
```

---

## Usage — GUI

The PySide6 desktop app is the primary interface. Launch it with `run.bat`.

### Step 1 — Scan sources

**File › Scan Sources…** opens the scan dialog.

1. Browse the embedded folder tree to find source directories.
   - Double-click or press **+ Add Selected Folder** to add a folder to the list.
   - Use **↑ / ↓** buttons to reorder sources (top row = highest dedup priority).
   - Tick or untick the **Recursive** checkbox per source — recursive scans all
     subdirectories; unticked scans only the immediate folder.
   - Use **×** to remove a source; **Remove All** to clear the list.
2. Set the **Save manifest to** path (defaults to `migration_manifest.sqlite`).
3. Click **Start Scan**. Progress is streamed to the log pane.
4. When the scan finishes, click **Close & Load** — the manifest loads
   directly into the review tree.

Source paths are persisted to `settings.json` (`sources.list`) between sessions.

### Step 2 — Review groups

The tree shows all files loaded from the manifest.

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Match** (col 0) | Scanner-assigned match type: `exact` / `similar` / *(empty for unmatched)* |
| **Sel** | Checkbox — select files for batch actions |
| **Action** (col 2) | Your decision: `delete` / `keep` / *(empty = undecided)* |

**Setting decisions:**

- *Per file*: right-click a file → **Set Action → delete** or **keep**.
- *By Sel checkboxes*: tick **Sel** on the files you want, then
  **File › Set Action to Selected (Sel) Files › delete** (or **keep**).
- *By highlight*: click or multi-select rows in the tree, then
  **File › Set Action to Activated Files › delete** (or **keep**).

### Step 3 — Save decisions

**File › Save Manifest Decisions…** opens a file picker. Choose the same
path to save in-place or a new path to export a copy. Decisions are written
to the chosen file, and subsequent saves default to that location.

### Step 4 — Execute actions

**File › Execute Action…** opens a full tree view (same columns as the main
window) showing all groups for final review.

- Right-click any file row → **Set Action** → change its decision before executing.
- If every file in a group is marked `delete`, an amber warning banner appears.
  Clicking **Execute** then opens a safety review dialog where you can type a
  regex to flip matching files from `delete` → `keep` before proceeding.
- Click **Execute** to carry out all decisions:
  - `delete` → file sent to the recycle bin (`send2trash`)
  - `keep` → marked as executed in the manifest (no file operation)
  - Files that no longer exist on disk are skipped and listed in a warning dialog.

All decision changes are batch-persisted to SQLite in a single transaction
immediately before execution.

## Usage — CLI

### `scan.py` — Deduplication scanner

```powershell
# Full recursive scan (sources listed in priority order)
python scan.py `
  --source photos="\\NAS\Photos\MobileBackup" `
  --source archive="D:\Archive" `
  --output migration_manifest.sqlite

# Mix recursive + flat (non-recursive) sources
python scan.py `
  --source archive="D:\Archive" `
  --source-flat inbox="D:\Inbox" `
  --output migration_manifest.sqlite

# Bounded debug run — stops after 200 files per source
python scan.py ... --limit 200

# Dry run — prints summary, does not write a manifest
python scan.py ... --dry-run

# Tighter near-duplicate threshold (default: 10 Hamming bits)
python scan.py ... --similarity-threshold 6
```

### `review.py` — Near-duplicate review CLI

Interactive terminal triage for `REVIEW_DUPLICATE` rows.

```powershell
python review.py --manifest migration_manifest.sqlite

# Include rows already resolved in a previous session
python review.py --manifest migration_manifest.sqlite --show-all
```

Per-pair choices: **[s]** skip candidate · **[k]** keep both · **[d]** defer  
Decisions persist immediately — the session is resumable at any time.

---

## Classification rules

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| SHA-256 match | `EXACT` (exact duplicate — lower-priority copy) |
| pHash hamming = 0, both lossy (JPG / HEIC / PNG) | `EXACT` lower-priority format (format duplicate) |
| pHash hamming = 0, one RAW + one lossy | `MOVE` both (complementary — always kept together) |
| pHash hamming 1–threshold | `REVIEW_DUPLICATE` — needs human triage |
| No EXIF `DateTimeOriginal` | `UNDATED` |
| Everything else | `MOVE` |

**Source priority** (exact duplicates): positional — order in the scan dialog (top = highest priority) or `--source` CLI flag order. No source receives a hardcoded `KEEP`.  
**Format priority** (FORMAT_DUPLICATE): `heic > jpeg > png > others`

---

## Similarity detection — what it catches and what it misses

The scanner uses two signals in sequence:

1. **pHash** (perceptual hash) — a 64-bit fingerprint of the image's macro brightness structure (DCT coefficients). Two images are candidates if their Hamming distance ≤ threshold (default 10 bits out of 64).
2. **Mean-color gate** — computes the average RGB of each image and rejects the pair when the colors differ by more than ~30 units (L2). This prevents images that share a similar composition but are clearly different colors from being flagged.

Neither signal reads faces, object identity, or text.

### What WILL be grouped as `REVIEW_DUPLICATE`

| Scenario | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Same photo saved as both JPEG and HEIC | Identical pHash, similar mean color |
| Same photo re-exported at different quality | pHash changes by ≤ a few bits |
| Burst shots of a static scene | Near-identical DCT structure |
| Minor brightness / contrast edits | DCT coefficients shift only slightly |
| Light crop or small rotation of a photo | pHash remains close when the main subject is unchanged |
| Photos of a uniformly white/black background | Very similar DCT → may group unrelated screenshots if mean color also matches |

### What will NOT be grouped (false negatives)

| Scenario | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Eyes open vs eyes closed | Pupil/eyelid change many DCT coefficients — Hamming distance grows beyond threshold |
| Standing vs sitting / different pose | Body position changes the spatial frequency content significantly |
| Hand-drawn annotation or sticker overlaid on a photo | The added lines/color shift both pHash and mean color |
| Heavy filter (sepia, high-contrast B&W) | Mean-color gate rejects the pair even when pHash is close |
| Major crop that removes the primary subject | pHash diverges once the dominant structure changes |
| Screenshot of a chat → same app, different content | Usually different pHash; but a uniform-background chat UI may slip through if content area is small |

### Tuning the threshold

Lower `--similarity-threshold` (e.g. 6) → fewer false positives, more false negatives.  
Higher threshold (e.g. 14) → more pairs flagged, including pose/blink variants — but also more noise.

The default of 10 is calibrated for a personal photo library where the main risk is missing a true duplicate. All flagged pairs land in `REVIEW_DUPLICATE` for human triage — nothing is deleted automatically.

---

## Scanner features

- **SHA-256** exact duplicate detection across all source folders
- **pHash** (imagehash) cross-format detection — JPEG vs HEIC vs RAW vs PNG
- **Hamming distance** configurable near-duplicate threshold
- **Live Photo pairs** — same-stem HEIC + MOV treated as an atomic unit
- **RAW + lossy** — DNG/ARW/CR3 always kept alongside their JPEG/HEIC partner
- **Magic-byte verification** — catches JPEG files saved with a `.HEIC` extension
- **Google Takeout numbering** — `IMG_9556(1).HEIC` handled correctly
- **Edited variants** — `-已編輯`, `-edited`, etc. excluded from pair matching
- **Batch EXIF** — exiftool `-stay_open` chunked at 500 files/call for speed
- **Cached metadata** — `file_size_bytes`, `shot_date`, `creation_date`, `mtime` written
  to the manifest at scan time; load reads from SQLite with zero filesystem round-trips

---

## Performance

| Scenario | Load time |
|----------|-----------|
| Old manifest (no cached columns) | 10+ min on NAS (filesystem stat per row) |
| New manifest (cached columns) | **< 1 second** (pure SQLite read) |

**How it works:** The scanner stores `file_size_bytes`, `shot_date`, `creation_date`, and
`mtime` in the manifest at scan time (when files are local). On subsequent opens,
`ManifestRepository.load()` reads these from SQLite — no `os.stat()` or Pillow EXIF
calls per row. Old manifests without these columns auto-migrate and fall back to the
original filesystem reads transparently (re-scan once to get the speed benefit).

Manifest loading runs in a **background `QThread`** (`ManifestLoadWorker`) so the UI
stays responsive while the manifest opens.

## Configuration (`settings.json`)

```json
{
  "sources": {
    "list": [
      { "path": "D:\\Archive",           "recursive": true  },
      { "path": "\\\\NAS\\MobileBackup", "recursive": true  },
      { "path": "D:\\Inbox",             "recursive": false }
    ],
    "output": "migration_manifest.sqlite"
  },
  "thumbnail_size": 512,
  "sorting": {
    "defaults": [
      { "field": "file_size_bytes", "asc": false },
      { "field": "file_path",       "asc": true  }
    ]
  }
}
```

Source paths and recursive flags set via **File › Scan Sources…** are saved here
automatically. List order determines dedup priority (index 0 = highest priority).

> **Migration**: if `settings.json` contains the old `sources.iphone` / `sources.takeout` /
> `sources.jdrive` keys, they are automatically converted to `sources.list` format on
> the first open of the Scan Sources dialog.
