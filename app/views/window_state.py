"""Window/dialog geometry persistence — shared by MainWindow + dialogs.

The save/restore plumbing around Qt's ``saveGeometry`` /
``restoreGeometry`` is the same for the main window (#141) and the
three resizable dialogs (#215). Centralising it here keeps:

  * the INI path resolution (``PHOTO_MANAGER_HOME``-anchored) in one
    place so dialogs and the main window always land in the same
    ``window_state.ini``;
  * the off-screen guard in one place so a multi-monitor disconnect
    can't strand any of them outside the visible desktop;
  * dialogs free of any import on ``MainWindow`` (would be a circular
    import via the DialogHandler pathway).
