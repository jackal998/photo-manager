"""Layer-1 tests for :class:`app.views.preview_pane.PreviewPane`
(#185 / final sibling PR).

Closes the 4th and final originally-listed #185 module. Mirrors
the pattern proved out by #283 (main_window) and #285
(group_media_controller): pure-logic extraction into a sibling
helper module + one real-construction test + fake-self
(``SimpleNamespace``) thin-proxy tests for every dispatch method.

## Pattern

* **One real-construction test** with the session ``qapp`` fixture
  to catch ``__init__`` / setup assembly reorders. The PreviewPane
  constructor builds a non-trivial widget hierarchy
  (``QScrollArea`` + ``QVBoxLayout`` + info label + single-image
  label + event filter wiring); a refactor that reorders any of
  these can leave a downstream method referencing an unset attr.
* **Fake-self unbound-method tests** for every dispatch method,
  helper-routed branch, and the load-bearing token-mismatch race
  in ``on_image_loaded`` (the owner's named failure mode).
* The pure-logic helpers are tested in
  ``test_preview_pane_helpers.py`` (sibling module).

## Not covered here (by design)

* Real image / video decoding via ``ImageTaskRunner`` — layer 3
  via s01 / s05 (image preview) + s11 (video preview).
* The full ``show_grid`` body — too Qt-heavy; the helper-routed
  decision points (``aspect_bucket_from_resolution``,
  ``compute_grid_geometry``, ``build_info_rows``) are pinned at L1
  via the helper tests + the grid-config tests below; the actual
  ``QGridLayout`` walk + tile placement is covered by L3 (s01).
* ``resizeEvent`` body — large method whose entire surface is Qt
  geometry adjustment; covered by L3 (s05 / s39 — preview pane
  geometry round-trip).

    * A regular JPEG returns wrong-shaped dims (transposed,

      shows wrong resolution to the user.
    * HEIC fallback isn't reached when QImageReader returns 0×0
      → resolution silently missing from the preview info.
    * Missing / corrupt file crashes the show_single info build
      instead of returning None gracefully.
